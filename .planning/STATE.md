## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Group sidebar jobs by source for v1.
- Initialization: Up/Down arrow keys should move selection through visible jobs and skip headers.
- Initialization: Keep Automation Health read-only; do not add job mutation controls.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Current worktree had pre-existing source changes when planning started; implementation should preserve unrelated user edits.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Alternate grouping | Health-based, schedule-based, and persisted custom grouping modes | Deferred | Initialization |
| Navigation | Additional shortcuts beyond Up/Down | Deferred | Initialization |
| Sidebar sections | Collapsible groups | Deferred | Initialization |
